In machine learning, gradient files are typically associated with the calculation of gradients used in optimization algorithms such as Gradient Descent. A gradient file generally contains the functions and methods to compute the gradients of a loss function with respect to model parameters. These gradients are used to adjust the parameters during the optimization process to minimize the loss function.

Key Points
Learning Rate: Small learning rates are used to ensure that the updates are gradual and the algorithm converges smoothly.
Convergence: You observe the error decreasing over iterations, which indicates that gradient descent is working correctly.
Weight Updates: The weights get updated in each iteration based on the gradients, and this process helps in minimizing the error.
Overall, your implementation covers the core aspects of gradient descent for linear regression. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part, feel free to ask
